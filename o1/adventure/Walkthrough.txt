You hear suspicious sounds downstairs. Your dog wakes up as well

You're thirsty

Go down the stairs, through the living room to the kitchen to grab some water.

You hear more sounds coming from the living room, you inspect it and the TV is on, playing weird sounds.

You go back upstairs to bed but there's now a scream coming from downstairs. Find the key in your bedroom cupboard to the attic where you keep your gun.

Open the attic and get the gun.

You go downstairs anxiously, there's no one there.

You go into the bathroom and look into the mirror, you look bad.

You hear another scream and ruffling downstairs. The dog starts barking at the stairs.

Your hands shake while holding the gun. You go downstairs to the living room.

You can't see your dog. The shuffling continues, now from the kitchen.

You raise your gun and shout: "who's there!"

Your dog jumps out of the kitchen, scaring you.

You can go into the bathroom and look in the mirro again. Something is off.

The tv turns on again by itself. You go downstairs to turn it off again.

From outside you hear screams and knocks on the window. You check the window

You don't recognise yourself at all in the reflection.

You raise the gun to your head and shoot.
