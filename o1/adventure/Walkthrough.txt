You wake up with your dog next to you. (pet dog)

You're thirsty

Go down the stairs, through the living room to the kitchen to grab some water.

You hear sounds coming from the living room, you inspect it and the TV is on, playing weird sounds.

You turn off the TV.

You go back upstairs to bed but there's now more sounds coming from downstairs. You go to living room, then kitchen. While in the kitchen you see movement in the corner of your eye.

You go to your phone in the hallway, trying to call a friend. They pick up and ask you what's wrong. The phone cuts off and you can't reach them again when you interact.

You panic. You want to get the gun.

Find the key in your bedroom cupboard to the attic where you keep your gun.

Open the attic and get the gun.

You go downstairs after hearing more sounds. It stops when you enter the living room, there's nothing there

(You go into the bathroom and look into the mirror, you look bad.)

Once you go into the kitchen you hear sounds in the livin groom again. The dog starts barking at the stairs.

Your hands shake while holding the gun. You go to the living room.

You can't see your dog. The shuffling continues, now from the kitchen.

When you switch between the living room and kitchen, the sound keeps coming from the other room.

Only stops once you go on the stairs.

The stairs feel longer than usual, you get concerned and freaked out. You can't go back down, only up.

You can go into the bathroom and look in the mirror again. Something is off.

You hear contiuous knocking on your bedroom window.

You're too exhausted to go down the stairs anymore.

You go into the bedroom and look into the window.

You don't recognise yourself at all in the reflection.

"Shoot"
